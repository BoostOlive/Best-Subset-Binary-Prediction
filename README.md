# Best-Subset-Binary-Prediction
Matlab implementation of the best subset maximum score binary prediction method proposed by Chen and Lee (2017).
Description of this prediction method and its computation details can be found in the paper:

Chen, Le-Yu and Lee, Sokbae (November 2017), "Best Subset Binary Prediction". The latest version of this paper can be found in this repository.

This implementation requires the matlab version of the Gurobi solver, which is freely available for academic purposes.
